# nip_append_only_list

Local-first Dart implementation of the **Nostr append-only lists NIP**
(kinds `1990` Add / `1991` Remove). Built on top of
[`ndk`](https://pub.dev/packages/ndk) and
[`broadcast_queue_shim_for_ndk`](https://pub.dev/packages/broadcast_queue_shim_for_ndk),
with a sembast-backed cleartext projection so previously-decrypted private
entries remain readable across restarts even before a signer reconnects.

## What this NIP solves

NIP-51 stores lists as *replaceable* events: every edit rewrites the whole
list, and concurrent edits from different devices silently overwrite each
other. This NIP keeps the NIP-51 tag/encrypted-content format unchanged but
stores each addition or removal as its own regular event:

- `kind:1990` - Add one or more entries to a list
- `kind:1991` - Remove one or more entries from a list

State is computed client-side as an **OR-Set CRDT**: an entry `e` is a
member of list `L` for author `P` iff `P` has signed at least one Add for
`(L, e)` and no Remove for `(L, e)` with a strictly later `created_at`.
Adds and Removes commute, so offline / multi-device edits converge without
coordination.

## Local-first design

Three persistence layers are wired by the caller:

1. **NDK `CacheManager`** - raw 1990/1991 events as received from relays
   (encrypted content preserved). Used for incremental sync (`since:
   <last_known_created_at>`).
2. **Cleartext projection** (this package's `ProjectionStore`, sembast) -
   per `(author, listName)` OR-Set bookkeeping in cleartext. Once a private
   entry has been decrypted with a signer, it stays readable at every
   subsequent boot, with or without the signer.
3. **`OfflineBroadcast`** (from
   `broadcast_queue_shim_for_ndk`) - durable outgoing queue. Writes return
   as soon as the event is persisted; delivery survives restarts and
   retries until every targeted relay acks.

> **Security note**: the projection stores cleartext for what was originally
> NIP-44 encrypted content. The caller is responsible for device-level
> protection (disk encryption, app sandbox).

## Install

```yaml
dependencies:
  nip_append_only_list: ^0.1.0
  ndk: ^0.8.4-dev.1
  broadcast_queue_shim_for_ndk: ^0.2.0
  sembast: ^3.8.7
```

## Usage

```dart
import 'package:broadcast_queue_shim_for_ndk/broadcast_queue_shim_for_ndk.dart';
import 'package:ndk/ndk.dart';
import 'package:nip_append_only_list/nip_append_only_list.dart';
import 'package:sembast/sembast_io.dart'; // or sembast_web on web

final ndk = Ndk(NdkConfig(
  eventVerifier: Bip340EventVerifier(),
  cache: await SembastCacheManager.create(databasePath: 'data'),
));

final outboxDb = await databaseFactoryIo.openDatabase('outbox.db');
final projectionDb = await databaseFactoryIo.openDatabase('projection.db');

final outbox = OfflineBroadcast.withNdk(ndk, db: outboxDb);
outbox.start();

final lists = AppendOnlyLists(
  ndk: ndk,
  outbox: outbox,
  projection: ProjectionStore(projectionDb),
  // Optional: cap the size of consolidation events so relays don't
  // reject huge fresh-Adds or deletion bundles. Default 32 KB.
  // maxEventBytes: 32 * 1024,
);

// Log an account into NDK so write methods pick up its signer
// automatically. Alternatives: `ndk.accounts.loginExternalSigner(...)`
// for a NIP-46 bunker / Amber / NIP-07 signer, or simply pass `signer:`
// explicitly on every call.
ndk.accounts.loginPrivateKey(pubkey: myPubkey, privkey: myPrivkey);

// Add three entries to a list named "fruits".
// `relays` is optional; when omitted, the author's NIP-65 write relays
// are resolved automatically via NDK.
await lists.add(
  listName: 'fruits',
  entries: const [
    AppendOnlyListEntry(tag: 't', value: 'apple'),
    AppendOnlyListEntry(tag: 't', value: 'banana'),
    AppendOnlyListEntry(tag: 't', value: 'cherry', private: true), // encrypted
  ],
);

// Remove one.
await lists.remove(
  listName: 'fruits',
  entries: const [AppendOnlyListEntry(tag: 't', value: 'banana')],
);

// Read - works offline, no signer needed for entries already projected.
final state = await lists.getList(
  pubkey: myPubkey,
  listName: 'fruits',
);
print(state.entries); // {apple, cherry (private)}

// Reactive view (initial snapshot + live updates).
final sub = lists.watchList(
  pubkey: myPubkey,
  listName: 'fruits',
).listen((s) => print(s.entries));

// Periodically compact: emits a fresh Add capturing current state and
// NIP-09-deletes the superseded events.
await lists.consolidate(listName: 'fruits');

await sub.cancel();
await lists.dispose();
```

## API surface

| Symbol | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `AppendOnlyListEntry` | `(tag, value, private?)` - identity is `(tag, value)` |
| `AppendOnlyListOp` | `add` (kind 1990) / `remove` (kind 1991) |
| `AppendOnlyListEvent` | Parsed event with separated public/private entries |
| `AppendOnlyListState` | Folded OR-Set state for one `(author, listName)` |
| `EntryStat` | Per-entry timestamps and presence test |
| `buildAppendOnlyEvent(...)` | Builds (unsigned) 1990/1991 events; encrypts private entries |
| `listFilter` / `deletionFilter` | NDK `Filter` builders |
| `ProjectionStore` | Sembast-backed cleartext state store |
| `AppendOnlyLists` | High-level usecase: read / write / watch / consolidate |

The CRDT core (`AppendOnlyListState.fromEvents`, `foldEvents`) is pure and
has no NDK dependency at runtime - it can be used standalone to fold any
collection of parsed events into a resolved set.

## Compatibility with NIP-51

This NIP is **complementary** to NIP-51, not a replacement. The two are
intended to coexist: NIP-51 remains appropriate for human-curated,
low-volume, mono-device lists; this NIP targets high-volume, automated,
multi-device, and offline-first workflows. Clients may mirror state between
the two for interoperability.
